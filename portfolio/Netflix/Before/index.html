<h1>Netflix: Rise to World Domination</h1>

<h2><em>Overview</em></h2>

<p>While there may be a few individuals that have not yet taken the plunge and subscribed to Netflix, it is safe to say that most people have heard of the company (founded in 1997) and how it has revolutionized the way that we view television and movies. By combining the concept of on-demand Internet streaming services with its traditional disc rentals by mail, Netflix offers many convenient ways to watch movies and TV shows for as low as $7.99 a month.</p>

<p>One aspect of Netflix's streaming services that have had a major influence on its success is how it took advantage of user dissatisfaction with traditional television methods by giving the viewer more control over how they watch their shows by adding whole seasons at once. Subscribers to Netflix have the authority to watch a TV show or movie whenever they want on any device with the benefit of no commercials. Netflix has also created many original TV series that are exclusive to Netflix subscribers. Because Netflix offers this flexibility that is absent in traditional television programs where new TV shows air weekly and are overrun with commercial ads, many users consider this an incredible improvement.</p>

</ol>

<p>After the company's substantial success in the United States, Netflix decided to expand their services internationally. Today, Netflix has already became a popular choice in the U.K., where "10% of all households have Netflix compared to the 4.5% who have Amazon's streaming service LoveFilm", despite Netflix only being available in the U.K. since 2012 (Pomerantz). The company is currently continuing their plan for world domination by attempting to set roots in other European countries where they've needed to improve their efforts, such as Germany and France.</p>

<p>Netflix's quick rise in popularity has resulted in many critics questioning the effects that the company's services and techniques may have on the future of television and society as a whole. As streaming services, such as Netflix, continue to allow people to view TV shows across many devices, I think it is safe to conclude that the lines between TV shows and a TV will continue to fade. All of our media, TV shows, movies, and music, will still progress towards digitalization until physical copies will be considered obsolete. These predictions are made based on the services offered by Netflix and the speed that the company is expanding globally. Pretty soon, Netflix will be available around the world!</p>
